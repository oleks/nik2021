\section{Introduction}

The purpose of revision control systems is to make the evolution of
digital artefacts auditable and change-wise revertible. That is:

\begin{enumerate}

\item to enable subsequent and independent review of individual
changes;

\item to keep changes traceable to individual authors and design
decisions; and

\item to enable the reverting of changes found foul or unnecessary.

\end{enumerate}

Contemporary revision control systems (RCS's) enable this, but
predominantly cater the domain of software development. This is for
historical reasons, as such systems have primarily evolved to meet the
needs of software development\cite{Rochkind:1975, Tichy:1982}. At the
same time, in our increasingly digital society, ensuring an auditable
and revertible evolution of digital artefacts, has become important in
numerous other domains.
